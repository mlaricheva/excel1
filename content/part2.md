# Part 2 

This is a second part of the Excel workshop series.

*This session is designed for users who previously had some experience with Excel and covers a range of skills from basic to intermediate levels. We will introduce basic Excel objects, data types and functions; show how to use formulas to describe sample data; walk through the process of preparing a data visualization and a simple pivot table.*
