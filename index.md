## Working with data in Excel

This is a first part of the Excel workshop series. This session is designed for users who previously had some experience with Excel and covers a range of skills from basic to intermediate levels. We will introduce basic Excel objects, data types and functions; show how to use formulas to describe sample data; walk through the process of preparing a data visualization and a simple pivot table.
